        <h2>How We Can Visualize Beyond What We See</h2>
        <p>With the current situation where the government allows the ladies to do abortion through the law depending on the health issue at hand. We see that society criticizes those ladies who become pregnant forcing them to conduct unsafe abortions leading to their deaths or some not being able to ever giving birth again.It is also evident that prisoners are always given the freedom to go back home after several years of being in prison. But when they get home they experience bitterness and disillusionment were the family members they had longed to see were dead and those who were there did accept them as changed people and this is also seen in our current  generation. In the book of Man's search for meaning,Frankl once treated a patient who was a devout Jewish rabbi whose first wife and children were killed in Auschwitz. His second wife could not have children, and he was depressed. Frankl observed that procreation isn’t the only meaning of life, or else life itself is meaningless. Then the rabbi said he had no son of his own to see him off when he died. Frankl countered that he would see his children in heaven. Then the real reason for the rabbi’s despair came up: The rabbi believed that his innocent children would go to the highest place in Heaven but as a sinful old man, he could not expect to be assigned the same place. Frankl said: Is it not conceivable that this is the exact reason why you survived your children? So that through your suffering you may be purified to join them one day? So perhaps none of your sufferings is in vain. This new point of view relieved the rabbi’s suffering for the first time.</p>

      <h4>What Young People Can Do To Navigate Through The Pandemic</h4>
      <p>This is the time they can be creative where they can build things and sell them in order to get money and also spend their time well trying to figure out what they really want in life. The current climate will force people to live at home with their parents longer to save money, work a college job a bit longer, or live with roommates since people don't have that much money. Families can also try to be supportive of their adults where they can always find time to talk to them about the situation at hand to make them feel they are not neglected. They can also always have a routine with their fellow youths with which they can decide to sensitive people about the deadly disease at hand and how they can protect themselves from contracting it.They can also have social media groups where they meet online to discuss issue affecting them with others to find a long-lasting solution to their problems</p>

       <h3>Impacts Of Colonialism To African Countries</h3>
       <p class="lightgrey-color">Negative impacts</p>
       <p>Africa needs a diverse education that is tailored to the economic needs of her people.In  that education must be free for the poor. No African child must be without education, merely because of his or her condition of poverty. And these African children must be taught the true history of Africa, not the colonial history of Africa’s invaders that is full of perfidy to protect their colonial interests.Most countries believe in sustaining their belief systems  and the youth  are affected to the  foreign influence in that they follow or try to imitate what they see from the whites making african countries loose their culture.</p>
