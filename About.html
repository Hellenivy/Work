        <h2>How We Can Visualize Beyond What We See</h2>
        <p>With the current situation where the government allows the ladies to do abortion through the law depending on the health issue at hand. We see that society criticizes those ladies who become pregnant forcing them toconduct unsafe abortions leading to their deaths or some not being able to ever giving birth again.It is also evident that prisoners are always given the freedom to go back home after several years of being in prison. But when they get home they experience bitterness and disillusionment were the family members they had longed to see were dead and those who were there did accept them as changed people and this is also seen in our current  generation. In the book of Man's search for meaning,Frankl once treated a patient who was a devout Jewish rabbi whose first wife and children were killed in Auschwitz. His second wife could not have children, and he was depressed. Frankl observed that procreation isn’t the only meaning of life, or else life itself is meaningless. Then the rabbi said he had no son of his own to see him off when he died. Frankl countered that he would see his children in heaven. Then the real reason for the rabbi’s despair came up: The rabbi believed that his innocent children would go to the highest place in Heaven but as a sinful old man, he could not expect to be assigned the same place. Frankl said: Is it not conceivable that this is the exact reason why you survived your children? So that through your suffering you may be purified to join them one day? So perhaps none of your sufferings is in vain. This new point of view relieved the rabbi’s suffering for the first time</p>

      <h4>What Young People Can Do To Navigate Through The Pandemic</h4>
      <p>This is the time they can be creative where they can build things and sell them in order to get money and also spend their time well trying to figure out what they really want in life. The current climate will force people to live at home with their parents longer to save money, work a college job a bit longer, or live with roommates since people don't have that much money. Families can also try to be supportive of their adults where they can always find time to talk to them about the situation at hand to make them feel they are not neglected. They can also always have a routine with their fellow youths with which they can decide to sensitive people about the deadly disease at hand and how they can protect themselves from contracting it.They can also have social media groups where they meet online to discuss issue affecting them with others to find a long-lasting solution to their problems</p>

       <h3>Impacts Of Colonialism To African Countries</h3>
       <p class="lightgrey-color">Negative impacts</p>
       <p>Africa needs a diverse education that is tailored to the economic needs of her people.In  that education must be free for the poor. No African child must be without education, merely because of his or her condition of poverty. And these African children must be taught the true history of Africa, not the colonial history of Africa’s invaders that is full of perfidy to protect their colonial interests.Most countries believe in sustaining their belief systems  and the youth  are affected to the  foreign influence in that they follow or try to imitate what they see from the whites making african countries loose their culture.</p>
       <p>Africans were taken as slaves to the new world and forced to work on the plantations without pay. On the African continent the Europeans seized land from the Africans to establish plantations for the growing of cash crops and forced the people to work on these plantations for a meagre. The African culture was diluted, traditions were taken away and their ways of life were destroyed. The African tradition religion was also destroyed due to the introduction of Christianity, they forced the people to learn their language, taught them how to eat European food and dress like Europeans abandoning their own traditional way of eating habits and dressing and the spread of virulent diseases. Families were torn apart due to partition of Africa which created new boundaries leading to present conflicts and the slave trade which millions of people away from their families and homelands. The Europeans took away most of their resources especially gold, diamonds, ivory and agricultural primary products. This never gave the Africans the opportunity to learn how to use their own resources for development.</p>

    <h4>Confidence</h4>
    <p>One needs to believe they'll be able to make it, too. This is very important, as you won't achieve anything without it. Never ever! If you don't believe in yourself, you'll start thinking all the best moments in your life are already gone. And this will be the case, if you keep thinking that way.</p>
    <p>Here are the importance of being confident</p>
<ul>
    <li>Greater self worth: the more self confidence you have, the more you value yourself and your capabilities, which means the more valuable you feel; this is what creates the effect of naturally holding your head up high, since you have higher self esteem and are proud of who you are</li>
    <li>More happiness and enjoyment: for all the reasons above, the more self confident you are, the happier you are with yourself; as a result, the more you always enjoy life</li>
    <li>Freedom from fear and anxiety: the more self confident you become, the more you know that you can accept, handle, learn, gain, and benefit from any situation, circumstance, or outcome; in this way, you naturally replace fear and anxiety with greater confidence in yourself and your abilities</li>
    <li>Freedom from social anxiety: the more secure you feel in your self worth, regardless of how others see you, the less concerned you are with what others might or might not think of you in social situations</li>
    More peace of mind and less stress: freedom from self doubt, fear, and anxiety naturally translates into greater peace of mind and a more stress-free life
    <li>More energy and motivation to act: the more confident you are that you can achieve things you want to achieve (like personal goals or dreams), the more motivated and energized you are to take action to achieve them</li>
    <li>More beneficial and enjoyable interactions with others: the happier and more confident you are, the more relaxed, comfortable, and at ease you are, and this naturally puts others at ease more around you; also, with these qualities, others tend to trust, respect, value, welcome, and cooperate with you more; the overall result is better and more enjoyable social interactions</li>
    <li>Better sleep & health: less fear and anxiety + less stress + more peace of mind + more happiness = you enjoying the health benefits of being more self confident, including better quality of sleep</li>
